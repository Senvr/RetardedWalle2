# RetardedWalle2
A "robot" (insult to robotics) to make an image based on distance with an ultrasonic sensor - like sonar.

## Why?
I did this to:
* Learn more in depth programming skills
* Get more into electrical engineering
* Make use of a sensor kit thing for arduino
* Make some sort of "product" that doesn't suck shit
* Something to do

## How?
This is operated with:
* 1 servo (Tower Pro SG90 Analog Servo)
* 1 Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
* 1 Play-Doh cup
* 5 shitloads of wires
* 400 metric fuckloads of coffee and 3 AM powerblasts

Note: Parts can be found [Here](https://www.amazon.com/Freenove-Processing-Oscilloscope-Voltmeter-Components/dp/B06X3V84PV)

## Usage?
Yes. Go ahead. To say no implies this has worth, which honestly, this has negative worth.

Note: Please read the lisence! It's short, and not proprietary!

Fun fact: The name, "RetardedWalle2" comes from the fact that the sensor makes it look like a wall-e. It's the 2nd "edition" of my ultasonic sensor based goodness. Also, it's "Retarded" because... well, let me remind you, I built the body of this in a play-doh canister. Another fun fact: I and this robot have something in common, and I'm the eldest sibling in my house.

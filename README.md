A "robot" (insult to robotics) to make an image based on distance with an ultrasonic sensor - like sonar.

##Why?
To learn:
More in-depth programming
Get more into electrical engineering
Make use of a sensor kit thing for arduino
Make some sort of "product" that doesn't suck shit
Something to do

##How?
This is operated with:
1 servo (Tower Pro SG90 Analog Servo)
Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
Play-Doh cup
Blood of the damned
Coffee and 3 AM powerblasts

Note: Parts can be found [Here](https://www.amazon.com/Freenove-Processing-Oscilloscope-Voltmeter-Components/dp/B06X3V84PV)


##Usage?
Yes. Go ahead. To say no implies this has worth, which honestly, this has negative worth.
